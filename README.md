# Simple-linear-regression
Simple linear regression is a statistical method that allows us to summarize and study relationships between two continuous (quantitative) variables:
One variable, denoted x, is regarded as the predictor, explanatory, or independent variable.
The other variable, denoted y, is regarded as the response, outcome, or dependent variable.
OLS is the method used to find the simple linear regression of a set of data.
The OLS method corresponds to minimizing the sum of square differences between the observed and predicted values.
